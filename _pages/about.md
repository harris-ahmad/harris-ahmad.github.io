# [About](#about)

As a skilled Software Engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science from LUMS, I specialize in backend and full-stack development. I have a proven track record of building scalable, efficient systems and applications for high-profile clients like Wallmart, Starbucks, and JLL. My expertise spans FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis, and ExpressJS, among other technologies. Notable projects include developing an asset management system, that enhanced application efficiency by 28%, creating a cross-platform health app, and leading a research project that significantly reduced data retrieval time. With a strong foundation in
both academic research and practical implementation, I bring a results-driven approach to every project.

During my undergrad, I was advised by [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/){:target="\_blank"}, [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/){:target="\_blank"}, and [Dr. Mian Muhammad Awais](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/516){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests focus on designing scalable, efficient backend systems and applications, where I work to optimize data retrieval and performance for high-profile clients. I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of distributed database design for large-scale applications, combining hands-on implementation with a solid research foundation.

Currently, I'm serving as a Software Engineer at [Linq.io](https://linq.io/), a company that offers an asset intelligence platform to streamline asset management and boost operational efficiency. I will be joining the University at Buffalo (SUNY) for PhD CSE in Spring'25 where I'll work under the guidance of [Dr. Haonan Lu](https://sites.google.com/view/haonanlu/home).
